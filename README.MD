# Data Analytics Project

This project is an implementation of a client application which connects to a backend server to collect data from a backend server, using its REST API. The backend is composed by a Flask web server and a database module which connects to a MongoDB remote database. All the applications are written in Python.

## Motivation

This architecture is used by a lot of companies over the world, and it is really important to a developer to understand how it works and how to implement it in your case. This model is flexible and it can be implemented using different programming languages and frameworks.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to give a practical overview about a real-world application using this system architecture. It is expected to help people that do not know how it works or do not have practical knowledge to implement it from scratch.

## Target Group

Any developer can be interested in this project, even those that do not use Python, because it can be easily implemented using a different stack, once the one understand how it works.

## System Architecture

The chosen technologies are currently used in different companies for many purposes and it can be really rewarding to a developer to get used with them, specially if it is needed to implement a communication between two applications.
